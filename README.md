## Overview

Remote Docker is a Docker Desktop extension that enables you to connect to and manage remote Docker hosts through SSH tunnels. It provides a seamless experience for managing containers, images, volumes, and networks on remote Docker installations directly from your Docker Desktop interface.

### Key Features

- üîê **Secure SSH Connections** - Connect to remote Docker hosts using SSH key authentication
- üñ•Ô∏è **Multi-Environment Support** - Manage multiple remote Docker environments
- üìä **Real-time Dashboard** - Monitor system resources, container statistics, and Docker events
- üê≥ **Full Docker Management** - Manage containers, images, volumes, and networks
- üìã **Container Logs** - View real-time logs with syntax highlighting and filtering
- üîÑ **Auto-refresh** - Keep data up-to-date with configurable auto-refresh intervals
- üé® **Dark Mode Support** - Seamless integration with Docker Desktop's theme

## Installation

### From Docker Hub

```bash
docker extension install telkombe/remote-docker:latest
```

### Manual Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/telkombe/remote-docker.git
cd remote-docker

# Build and install locally
make build
docker extension install telkombe/remote-docker:latest
```

## Quick Start

1. **Install the extension** from Docker Hub
2. **Open the extension** in Docker Desktop
3. **Add a remote environment**:
   - Click "Add Environment"
   - Enter a name for your environment
   - Provide the SSH connection details:
     - Hostname: Your remote Docker host (e.g., `192.168.1.25`)
     - Username: SSH username (e.g., `ubuntu`)
     - Port: SSH port (default: 22)
4. **Connect** to start managing your remote Docker environment

## Requirements

### Local Machine
- Docker Desktop 4.8.0 or later
- SSH key pair for authentication

### Remote Host
- Docker Engine installed and running
- SSH server with key-based authentication enabled
- User with Docker permissions (typically in the `docker` group)

## SSH Key Setup

The extension uses SSH key authentication for secure connections. Your SSH keys are automatically mounted from your local `.ssh` directory.

### Windows
```powershell
# Keys are read from
C:\Users\<username>\.ssh\id_rsa
C:\Users\<username>\.ssh\id_rsa.pub
```

### macOS/Linux
```bash
# Keys are read from
~/.ssh/id_rsa
~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

### Setting up SSH Keys

1. **Generate SSH keys** (if you don't have them):
   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
   ```

2. **Copy your public key to the remote host**:
   ```bash
   ssh-copy-id username@remote-host
   ```

3. **Test the connection**:
   ```bash
   ssh username@remote-host docker version
   ```

## Features in Detail

### Dashboard
- System information and Docker version
- Resource utilization (CPU, Memory, Disk)
- Container statistics and distribution
- Recent Docker events
- Real-time metrics with auto-refresh

### Container Management
- View all containers with status
- Start/stop containers
- View container logs with syntax highlighting
- Port mapping information
- Docker Compose project grouping

### Image Management
- List all images with size information
- Remove unused images
- View image details and layers

### Network Management
- List Docker networks
- View network configuration
- Delete unused networks

### Volume Management
- List Docker volumes
- View volume details
- Remove unused volumes

## Configuration

### Environment Settings
Each environment can be configured with:
- **Name**: Friendly name for the environment
- **Hostname**: IP address or domain name
- **Port**: SSH port (default: 22)
- **Username**: SSH username

### Auto-refresh Settings
- Enable/disable auto-refresh per view
- Configurable refresh intervals (15s, 30s, 60s, 300s)
- Visual indicators for refresh status

## Security

- **SSH Key Authentication**: Only SSH key authentication is supported (no passwords)
- **Local Key Storage**: SSH keys remain on your local machine
- **Read-only Mounts**: Keys are mounted read-only in the extension container
- **No Keys in Images**: Docker images do not contain any SSH keys
- **Secure Tunneling**: All Docker API communication goes through SSH tunnels

## Architecture

### Components

The extension consists of two main parts:

1. **Backend (Go)**
   - Handles SSH tunnel creation and management
   - Proxies Docker commands to remote hosts
   - Built with Echo framework

2. **Frontend (React/TypeScript)**
   - Provides a UI for remote Docker management
   - Features a responsive dashboard with real-time updates
   - Built with Material UI components and Recharts for data visualization

### How It Works

1. The extension mounts your local `~/.ssh` directory as read-only
2. When you connect to a remote environment, it creates an SSH tunnel
3. Docker commands are proxied through the tunnel to the remote Docker daemon
4. Results are displayed in the familiar Docker Desktop UI

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Permission denied" SSH Error
- Ensure your SSH key has proper permissions (600 on Unix-like systems)
- Verify the remote user is in the `docker` group
- Check SSH key is correctly added to remote host's `authorized_keys`

#### Blank Screen on Extension Load
- Check Docker Desktop console for errors (View ‚Üí Developer Tools)
- Ensure Docker Desktop is up to date
- Try reinstalling the extension

#### Cannot Connect to Remote Host
- Verify SSH connection works: `ssh username@hostname`
- Check Docker is running on remote: `ssh username@hostname docker ps`
- Ensure no firewall is blocking SSH port

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging in the extension:
1. Open Docker Desktop Developer Tools
2. Check console for detailed error messages
3. Look for API response errors

## Development

See [docs/development.md](docs/development.md) for development setup and contribution guidelines.
