# MCP Toolkit Integration for Remote Docker

## Overview

The MCP (Model Context Protocol) Toolkit integration allows users to run MCP servers on remote Docker hosts, providing the same functionality as Docker Desktop's local MCP implementation but for remote environments.

## Architecture

### Components

1. **MCP Manager Service** (Backend)
   - Manages MCP server lifecycle on remote hosts
   - Handles SSH tunneling for MCP connections
   - Monitors MCP server status

2. **MCP UI Component** (Frontend)
   - Server selection interface
   - Configuration management
   - Status monitoring dashboard

3. **MCP Bridge** (Remote)
   - Docker container running on remote host
   - Exposes MCP server endpoints
   - Manages tool permissions

### Flow

```
Docker Desktop Extension
    |
    ├── MCP UI Component
    |   └── Select/Configure MCP Servers
    |
    ├── Extension Backend
    |   ├── MCP Manager Service
    |   └── SSH Tunnel Manager
    |
    └── Remote Docker Host
        ├── MCP Server Container
        └── Tool Containers
```

## MCP Server Types

1. **Filesystem MCP Server**
   - Access remote filesystem
   - File operations (read, write, list)
   - Directory navigation

2. **Docker MCP Server**
   - Container management
   - Image operations
   - Volume/Network access

3. **Shell MCP Server**
   - Execute commands
   - Script execution
   - Process management

4. **Custom MCP Servers**
   - User-defined tools
   - Custom integrations
   - Plugin architecture

## Security Considerations

1. **Authentication**
   - SSH key-based auth for tunnel
   - MCP server API keys
   - Per-tool permissions

2. **Network Security**
   - All traffic through SSH tunnel
   - No direct MCP port exposure
   - Encrypted communication

3. **Access Control**
   - Tool-level permissions
   - Read-only mode support
   - Audit logging
