## 🚦 Next Steps for You

### 1. Handle Dependabot PRs (High Priority)
There are currently 5 open Dependabot PRs that need attention:

```bash
# Use the automated script
./scripts/merge-dependabot.sh

# Or handle manually via GitHub web interface
```

**PRs to review**:
- Bump golang.org/x/net from 0.33.0 to 0.38.0 in /backend
- Bump vite from 6.2.0 to 6.3.5 in /ui (already fixed locally)
- Bump golang.org/x/crypto from 0.31.0 to 0.35.0 in /backend  
- Bump @babel/runtime from 7.26.9 to 7.27.6 in /ui (already fixed locally)
- Bump npm dependencies group update

### 2. Configure Repository Settings
Optional: Use the Settings GitHub App to apply `.github/settings.yml`:
1. Install https://github.com/apps/settings
2. It will automatically apply the configuration

Or manually configure:
- Enable branch protection on `main` branch
- Require status checks before merging
- Enable auto-delete of branches after merge

### 3. Monitor Workflows
- Check https://github.com/anubissbe/remote-docker/actions
- Ensure all workflows are passing
- Review any security alerts in the Security tab

### 4. Docker Hub Cleanup (Optional)
Clean up old test tags on Docker Hub:
- Visit https://hub.docker.com/r/telkombe/remote-docker/tags
- Delete test tags: `debug`, `test`, `debug-test`, `fixed`, `inline-test`, `minimal`, `fixed-path`
